Convolutional neural network (CNN).Use MNIST Fashion Dataset and
create a classifier to classify fashion clothing into categories.


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks that are specially
designed to analyze and classify images, videos, and other types of multidimensional data. They are
widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.
The main idea behind CNNs is to perform convolutions, which are mathematical operations that
apply a filter to an image or other input data. The filter slides over the input data and performs a dot
product between the filter weights and the input values at each position, producing a new output
value. By applying different filters at each layer, the network learns to detect different features in the
input data, such as edges, shapes, and textures.
CNNs typically consist of several layers that perform different operations on the input data. The
most common types of layers are:
